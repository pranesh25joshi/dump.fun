{"text":"The future looks even crazier: Next week: ETHIndia + Unfold in Bangalore. Building DASHH, our flagship product, to make Web3 mobile-friendly. Integrating Blockchain &amp; Android to bring Web3 to your pocket. 📱"}
{"text":"Next up: Decentralizedathon 🏃 Another hackathon, another WIN. This time, we started realizing the true power of Blockchain. From building dApps to creating impact, Web3 isn’t just tech; it’s a whole vibe. 🌐✨"}
{"text":"First project? We built @dashh_media in just 3 days for Solana's biggest hackathon – Riptide. Result? We WON IT. 🏆 Also: Applied for a $2000 grant. Us: \"Will they really approve this?\" Blockchain: HOLD MY BEER. 🍺"}

{"text":"Out of the 6-hour window, I was only able to utilize around 45 minutes to solve problems due to repeated server issues. TCSCodeVita, this experience needs to be addressed. Such issues during a competitive coding event diminish the credibility of the competition"}

{"text":"At around 9:20 AM, as I tried to submit my first answer, the page refreshed. When I attempted to log in again, the site stopped responding. I kept trying but failed. I reached out to a friend, and he was facing the same issue. It felt unfair as the servers weren’t cooperating."}
